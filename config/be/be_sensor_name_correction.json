/* (start of comment)

This config file contains correction information for wrong sensor names from raw-data-input-files.

Original sensor names are mapped to corrected sensor names.
This mapping is applied before the sensor name translation step with information from config file "be_sensor_translation.ini".

Each entry contains start and end date of validity. 
Only files with a time-interval that is completely within the time-interval of the entry are applied to the correction-entry.
Files wiht a time-interval that is (partly) outside of an entry are NOT applied. 
So its possible to define start and end date imprecise (a bit lower for start resp. a bit higher for end).
If multiple entries fit to one file and raw sensor name the first entry is applied.

File format is JSON with block comments.

file structure (as JSON array of entries):
[
<ENTRY1>,
<ENTRY2>,
<ENTRY3>,
]

entry structure (as JSON object):
{plot:"<PLOT_NAME>", raw:"RAW_SENSOR_NAME", correct:"CORRECTED_SENSOR_NAME", start:"START_DATE", end:"END_DATE"}

date format (ISO 8601):

YEAR-MONTH-DAY

YYYY eg. 2009
YYYY-MM eg. 2009-12
YYYY-MM-DD eg. 2009-12-31
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm eg. 2009-12-31T14:09

For unspecified start or end "*" can be used.

Shortened end dates are set to end of that period e.g. end date 2009 leads to 2009-12-31T23:59
